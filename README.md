# Quick start
Recover your data from huge Html tables and create new Html tables with new user-defined layout! You do **not** need to create a new table, you can use this program simply to get your data without Html tags!

The program is designed to work with Windows, Linux and Mac. 

**NOTE:** You have to compile the program by yourself with C++11

# How to use
The usage of this program is easy, but little spelling or sintax mistakes can cause big errors.

To learn how to correcly use this tool visit the [WIKI] (https://github.com/Ricky-IT/Html-Table-Builder/wiki).
The wiki is available in English and Italian.

## New version in development
I'm building a completely new and better version of this program.
The program will be completely redesigned to grant more flexibility and more functionalities, so I decided to put it into a new repo [that can be found here] (https://github.com/RickyCoDev/Html_Table_Editor)
